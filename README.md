#Tetris

##Description

The classic tetris game implemented in python 2.7 / pygame 1.9.2. You can start it from main.py (should work on unix as well, although I haven't tested it.
You can also try the game out from the exe (only tested on windows 7 x64, may not work on XP).

The goal of this project was to design a *very basic* game engine. I think it turned out ok.
